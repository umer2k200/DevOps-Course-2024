### [“Ball-e-Baaz”: Revolutionizing cricket with AI and modern technology ](https://medium.com/@umarzeeshan709/ball-e-baaz-revolutionizing-cricket-with-ai-and-modern-technology-6ea9034e945d)

This blog is about my FYP, "Ball-e-Baaz" which is an AI-powered mobile app designed to revolutionize cricket by integrating advanced features into one platform. It addresses gaps in existing cricket technology, such as fragmented tools for ball tracking, player recommendations, and ground bookings. Key features include AI-driven Decision Review System (DRS), real-time ball tracking, smart player recommendations, weather-checked ground bookings, and a collaborative community platform. Built using modern frameworks like React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, the app aims to enhance the cricketing experience for players, coaches, and teams, making the game smarter, more efficient, and connected.

### [Setting up a Kubernets cluster on Windows with Minikube ](https://medium.com/@umarzeeshan709/setting-up-a-kubernets-cluster-on-windows-with-minikube-67fa19e3d6a5)

The blog provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a local Kubernetes cluster on Windows using Minikube. Minikube is a lightweight tool that allows developers to experiment with Kubernetes on a single-node cluster. It covers prerequisites like enabling Hyper-V and installing Minikube and kubectl. The blog walks through starting the cluster, verifying it, deploying an NGINX application, accessing the Kubernetes dashboard, and stopping or deleting the cluster. It also addresses common issues such as Hyper-V permissions and resource limitations, making it a practical resource for developers exploring Kubernetes locally.

### [A Comprehensive Guide to GitHub Actions ](https://medium.com/@umarzeeshan709/a-comprehensive-guide-to-github-actions-73b4c7bd3255)

The blog provides a detailed guide to using GitHub Actions, a CI/CD tool that automates workflows directly within GitHub repositories. It explains how GitHub Actions enables developers to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying applications triggered by repository events such as pushes or pull requests. The workflows are defined in YAML files stored in the .github/workflows directory.

The blog includes a step-by-step example for setting up a GitHub Actions workflow for a MERN stack application. It guides users through creating a repository, setting up a project locally, pushing code to GitHub, and adding a workflow YAML file to automate backend and frontend testing. It also explains monitoring workflow execution in the GitHub Actions tab. This comprehensive guide showcases how GitHub Actions simplifies development and deployment by automating repetitive tasks.
